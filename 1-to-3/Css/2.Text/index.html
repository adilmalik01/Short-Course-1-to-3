        Naproxen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which can be used for the treatment of inflammatory
        disorders like uveitis and arthirit rheumatoid. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
        physicochemical characteristics of naproxen–PLGA nanoparticles. The nanoparticles of naproxen with PLGA
        were formulated using the solvent evaporation/extraction technique (the single emulsion technique).
        Several process parameters i.e., drug/polymer ratio, aqueous phase volume and speed of homogenization
        were considered with the aim of achieve optimal preparation conditions. The physicochemical characteristics of
        nanoparticles were studied applying particle size analysis, differential scanning calorimetry,
        X-ray crystallography, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The
        release rate of naproxen from various drug/polymer nanoparticles was investigated as well. All the prepared
        formulations using PLGA resulted in nano-range size particles (352–571 nm) with spherical smooth
        morphology. The nanoparticles of naproxen–PLGA displayed lower crystallinity with no chemical interactions
        between the drug and polymer molecules. The nanoparticles exhibited the slower release of drug
        in comparison with the intact drug and the physical mixtures. According of these findings, formulation
        of the naproxen–PLGA nanoparticles was able to improve the physicochemical characteristics of the
        drug and possibly will increase the anti-inflammatory effects of drug following its ocular or intra-joint
        administration

    <h1 class="firstH1">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="secondPara">
        The application of polymer-based nanoparticles exploiting
        biodegradable polymers is far and wide expected to amend the
        redesign of pharmaceutical industries for the foreseeable future
        [1–6]. Biodegradable polymers derived from lactic acid and glycolic
        acid give the impression to benefit pharmaceutical industries for
        the delivery of various drugs [7]. Among the various biodegradable
        polymers for preparation of nanoparticles, PLGA [poly(d,l-lactideco-glycolide)] is highly preferred for the drug
        delivery applications.
        PLGA polymers are already approved by the US Food and Drug
        Administration (FDA), for employment in drug delivery purposes
        [7,8]. Applying these nanoparticles, drugs can be delivered in a
        sustained manner and encapsulated drugs are protected in the
        polymer network from gastric and enzymatic degradation as well.

        2.1. Materials
        Naproxen was purchased from Pars Daru Co. (Tehran, Iran).
        Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) (50:50 d,l-lactide:glycolide)
        with average molecular weight of 12,000 g/mol (Resomer RG 502),
        was obtained from Boehringer Ingelheim, (Germany). Polyvinyl
        alcohol (PVA, MW 95,000) was obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen,
        Germany). All the other chemicals were of the highest available
        grade.
